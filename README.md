Instructions for installing tkinter- In your python terminal, run command python -m tkinter.
It comes pre-installed due to having python already installed.
The only way to contribute to the repository is to first clone the repo. I recommend using github desktop for simplicity but using git in the terminal is also an option

Want to make a contribution? Make a Git Branch using command git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name. Contributors can work on their branch locally, commit changes and then push the changes to their branch repository.Push command  -  git push origin feature/your-feature-name. TLDR: Make a branch, make your changes, push changes to branch. We can review the code changes together, and if everything works, we can merge that branch into the main branch.Heres a video explanation too: https://youtu.be/iv8rSLsi1xo?si=b3OtKKNZZ-EHX3_z
